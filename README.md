# ejb-j2ee

Implemented a j2ee which contains enterprise java beans and a remote client java application which invokes these beans by using JNDI.
Use JBOSS as application server.

In server side there are two session beans. One of them Stateful and the other one is Stateless.
These beans invoked from a remote client in client side.
